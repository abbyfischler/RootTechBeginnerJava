<h1>Root Tech Beginner Java Camp</h1>
<h3>Throughout the 2 weeks I made different projects and concluded with a Gambling Game.</h3>
<p>I made a Gambling Game that generate 80 numbers, where 20 numbers are selected as winning numbers randomly. The user will input a number and that number will then be used to check if it is a winning number or a losing number. When the game is run, there will be a balance that the player has, which starts at $10. Each bet costs $1, each win gives $5, the game ends when the playerâ€™s balance either reaches $0 or $100. Display the balance each time a bet is made, multiple bets can be made in one run of random generated numbers.The bets cannot be on the same number, each bet must be on a unique number. Regardless of if they win or lose the bet, remember that they will spend the $1. After each round of bets, the winning numbers should be randomly shuffled again
